# Demo Preparation Guide - Universal 1Password Agent Credential Broker

**Task:** 8.2.1 - Create presentation materials  
**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## üéØ Demo Overview

This guide prepares you for demonstrating the **Universal 1Password Agent Credential Broker** - a multi-protocol credential management system supporting MCP, A2A, and ACP protocols for AI agent ecosystems.

### **Demo Objectives**
- Showcase multi-protocol support (MCP, A2A, ACP)
- Demonstrate zero-trust security model
- Highlight real-time audit capabilities
- Prove ecosystem interoperability

---

## üé¨ Demo Script & Flow

### **Opening (2 minutes)**

**Problem Statement:**
> "AI agents are becoming autonomous and diverse, but they need secure access to credentials. Traditional approaches create security risks - hardcoded secrets, over-privileged access, and no audit trail. Today I'll show you a universal solution."

**Solution Overview:**
> "I built a credential broker that supports three different agent communication protocols - MCP, A2A, and ACP - providing ephemeral, encrypted credentials with complete audit logging. It's zero-trust security for AI agents."

**Value Proposition:**
- ‚úÖ **Protocol Agnostic**: Works with any AI framework
- ‚úÖ **Zero Standing Privilege**: 5-minute credential lifetime
- ‚úÖ **Complete Audit Trail**: Every access logged
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Docker deployment, health checks

---

### **Technical Demo (10 minutes)**

#### **Demo 1: MCP Protocol (3 minutes)**

**Setup:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start MCP server
python src/mcp/run_mcp.py

# Terminal 2: Run demo
python demos/mcp_demo.py
```

**Narrative:**
> "Here's an AI assistant requesting database credentials as a tool call. This is the Model Context Protocol - think ChatGPT or Claude Desktop needing to access a database."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Tool discovery: "The AI discovers our `get_credentials` tool"
- Secure request: "Notice the structured input - resource type, name, agent ID"
- Token generation: "We generate an encrypted JWT token with 5-minute expiry"
- Audit logging: "Every access is logged to 1Password Events API"

**Visual Elements:**
- Show tool discovery output
- Highlight token structure (first 20 chars)
- Point to audit log entries
- Demonstrate token expiry countdown

#### **Demo 2: A2A Protocol (3 minutes)**

**Setup:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start A2A server
python src/a2a/run_a2a.py

# Terminal 2: Run demo
python demos/a2a_demo.py
```

**Narrative:**
> "Here's agent-to-agent collaboration. A data analysis agent discovers our credential broker and requests access. No hardcoded secrets, just secure agent-to-agent communication."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Agent discovery: "The agent discovers our capabilities via the Agent Card"
- Task execution: "Structured task submission with parameters"
- Real-time streaming: "Long operations stream progress updates"
- Bearer authentication: "Secure agent-to-agent communication"

**Visual Elements:**
- Show Agent Card JSON structure
- Highlight capability definitions
- Demonstrate task submission/response
- Show SSE streaming (if applicable)

#### **Demo 3: ACP Protocol (3 minutes)**

**Setup:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start ACP server
python src/acp/run_acp.py

# Terminal 2: Run demo
python demos/acp_demo.py
```

**Narrative:**
> "Here's natural language credential requests. A CrewAI agent makes a conversational request, and our system parses intent and provisions credentials with session tracking."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Natural language: "The agent speaks in plain English"
- Intent parsing: "We extract resource type and name automatically"
- Session management: "Conversation context is maintained"
- Structured response: "Clean JSON response with token and metadata"

**Visual Elements:**
- Show natural language input
- Highlight intent parsing output
- Demonstrate session history
- Show structured response format

#### **Dashboard Demo (1 minute)** [If Implemented]

**Setup:**
```bash
# Start dashboard
streamlit run src/ui/dashboard.py
# Visit http://localhost:8501
```

**Narrative:**
> "This real-time dashboard shows all three protocols in action, with live metrics and audit events streaming."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Live metrics: "Active tokens, request counts, success rates"
- Protocol comparison: "Side-by-side usage visualization"
- Audit stream: "Real-time event logging"
- Interactive testing: "Test all protocols from one interface"

---

### **Closing (3 minutes)**

#### **Architecture Benefits**
- **Protocol Agnostic**: Single broker, multiple protocols
- **Unified Security**: Consistent encryption and audit across all protocols
- **Scalable Design**: Async architecture handles concurrent requests

python src/mcp/run_mcp.py
```

**Issue:** 1Password Connect API errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check health
curl http://your-connect-server/health
# Verify credentials in .env file
```

**Issue:** Demo scripts fail
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run health check first
./scripts/health-check.sh
# Test individual components
python -c "from src.core.credential_manager import CredentialManager; print('‚úì Core ready')"
```

**Issue:** Dashboard not loading
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Streamlit is running
ps aux | grep streamlit
