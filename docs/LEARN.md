# Universal 1Password Agent Credential Broker - Interview Prep Guide

**Project:** Multi-Protocol Credential Broker (MCP + A2A + ACP)  
**Phases Completed:** Phase 1 (Foundation), Phase 2 (MCP Server), Phase 3 (A2A Server)  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project implements a **Universal Credential Broker** that provides just-in-time ephemeral credentials to AI agents through three modern protocols: **MCP** (Model Context Protocol), **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent), and **ACP** (Agent Client Protocol).

**The Core Problem We Solve:**
- AI agents need credentials to access databases, APIs, and services
- Traditional credential management creates security risks (stolen keys, over-privileged access)
- We provide **zero standing privilege** through ephemeral tokens that expire automatically

**Key Innovation:**
- Single broker supporting three different agent communication protocols
- 5-minute default credential lifetime (max 15 minutes)
- AES-256 encrypted JWT tokens
- Complete audit trail for compliance

## 📖 Interview Q&A: Protocol Fundamentals

### Understanding the Three Protocols

**Q: Let's start with the basics - what are MCP, A2A, and ACP, and why do we need three different protocols?**

**A:** Great question! Think of these as different "languages" that AI systems speak depending on their use case:

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - This is like giving tools to an AI assistant. Imagine Claude or ChatGPT needs to check a database - MCP lets them discover and call tools (like "get_credentials") as if they're built-in functions. It's standardized by Anthropic and uses a simple client-server model over stdio (standard input/output).

**A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)** - This is for agents collaborating with each other. Picture one agent that analyzes data needing credentials from a credential agent. A2A uses REST APIs and supports agent discovery through "Agent Cards" - like a business card that says "here's what I can do for you." It's designed for enterprise integration.

**ACP (Agent Client Protocol)** - This is specifically for code editors and IDEs working with AI coding agents. Zed built this for their AI assistant to autonomously modify code. It's more conversational and session-based - the agent can ask the client to read files, write code, execute terminal commands.

**Why three?** Different ecosystems have different needs. CrewAI agents prefer REST APIs (A2A), Claude Desktop uses tools (MCP), and code editors need file system access (ACP). By supporting all three, our broker works everywhere.

---

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Deep Dive

**Q: Walk me through how MCP actually works. What happens when an AI assistant needs credentials?**

**A:** Let me break down the MCP flow step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The client (like Claude Desktop) spawns our broker as a subprocess. They exchange a handshake:
   - Client says: "I support MCP version 2025-06-18, here are my capabilities"
   - Server responds: "Great! I support tools with dynamic updates"

2. **Tool Discovery**: The client asks "what tools do you have?" using a JSON-RPC call to `tools/list`. We respond with our `get_credentials` tool definition, including the input schema (resource_type, resource_name, ttl_minutes).

3. **Tool Execution**: When the AI decides it needs database credentials:
   - Client calls: `tools/call` with arguments like `{resource_type: "database", resource_name: "prod-postgres"}`
   - We fetch credentials from 1Password
   - Encrypt them with AES-256
   - Generate a JWT token with 5-minute expiry
   - Return it to the client

4. **Communication**: All messages go through stdin/stdout using JSON-RPC 2.0. Errors go to stderr.

**The beauty of MCP** is that from the AI's perspective, getting credentials looks just like calling any other tool - like a calculator or weather API.

---

**Q: What are the key architectural components of MCP?**

**A:** MCP has three main primitives:

**Tools** - Functions the AI can call. Like our `get_credentials` tool. Each tool has:
- A name and description
- An input schema (JSON Schema format)
- Returns structured content (text, embedded resources, or links)

**Resources** - Data sources the AI can read. Think of these like "here's a file" or "here's a database connection string". Resources have URIs and can be listed/read.

**Prompts** - Pre-defined prompt templates for common tasks. We haven't implemented these yet, but you could have a prompt like "help me securely connect to a database."

**Transports** - How messages are sent:
- **stdio**: For desktop apps (what we use)
- **HTTP with SSE**: For web-based clients
- **WebSocket**: For bidirectional real-time communication

---

**Q: How does MCP handle dynamic updates? What if new tools become available?**

**A:** That's where the `listChanged` capability comes in. When a server's tools change:

1. Server sends a notification: `tools/list_changed` (no response expected)
2. Client receives notification and requests fresh tool list: `tools/list`
3. Server responds with updated tools
4. Client updates its internal registry

This is crucial for production systems where capabilities might be added/removed dynamically based on user permissions or system state.

---

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Deep Dive

**Q: How is A2A different from MCP in practice?**

**A:** A2A is designed for **agent-to-agent collaboration** rather than AI-to-tool interaction. Key differences:

**Architecture:**
- A2A uses standard HTTP/REST instead of stdio
- Supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming long-running tasks
- Built for enterprise environments (uses bearer tokens, CORS, standard security practices)

**Discovery:**
- Instead of tool lists, A2A uses **Agent Cards** - JSON documents that describe:
  - Agent identity (name, version, description)
  - Capabilities (what tasks it can perform)
  - Input/output schemas for each capability
  - Communication modes (text, JSON, protobuf)
  - Authentication requirements

**Task Execution:**
- Client posts a task request with:
  - Task ID (for tracking)
  - Capability name (e.g., "request_database_credentials")
  - Parameters (e.g., database_name, duration_minutes)
  - Requesting agent ID
- Server responds with task status (completed/failed/in-progress)

**Real-world example:**
A data analysis agent needs to query a production database:
1. It discovers our credential agent via the `/agent-card` endpoint
2. Sees we have a `request_database_credentials` capability
3. Posts a task request with the database name
4. Receives an ephemeral token in the response
5. Uses that token to authenticate to the database
6. Token expires automatically after 5 minutes

---

**Q: Tell me about A2A's streaming capabilities. Why would you need that for credential provisioning?**

**A:** Great question! While credential provisioning is typically fast, streaming makes sense for several reasons:

**Use Cases:**
- **Progress Updates**: "Connecting to 1Password... Validating vault access... Fetching credentials... Encrypting..."
- **Long-Running Operations**: If we need to provision credentials for multiple resources in one request
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: "Waiting for admin approval for production database access..."

**How it works:**
- Client subscribes to `/task/{task_id}/stream`
- Server sends Server-Sent Events (SSE) with updates
- Each event has: status, progress percentage, timestamp
- Client can close the stream anytime
- Final event indicates completion or error

**Example flow:**
```
data: {"status": "started", "task_id": "abc-123", "progress": 0}
data: {"status": "provisioning", "task_id": "abc-123", "progress": 50}
data: {"status": "completed", "task_id": "abc-123", "progress": 100, "result": {...}}
```

This provides **better UX** for agent systems that have visual interfaces or need to coordinate multiple sub-agents.

---

**Q: What does the Agent Card actually contain? Why is it important?**

**A:** The Agent Card is essentially a **self-describing API contract**. Ours includes:

**Identity:**
- `agent_id`: "1password-credential-broker"
- `name`: "1Password Ephemeral Credential Agent"
- `version`: "1.0.0"

**Capabilities** (we define 4):
- `request_database_credentials`
- `request_api_credentials`
- `request_ssh_credentials`
- `request_generic_credentials`

Each capability specifies:
- Input schema: what parameters are required/optional
- Output schema: what you'll get back
- Descriptions for AI understanding

**Why it matters:**
- **Discovery**: Agents can automatically find and understand what we offer
- **Validation**: Client and server agree on contracts upfront
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting API
- **Versioning**: Clients can check compatibility before attempting tasks

It's like OpenAPI/Swagger but designed specifically for agent-to-agent communication.

---

### Agent Client Protocol (ACP) Deep Dive

**Q: ACP seems different from the other two. What's its primary use case?**

**A:** Exactly! ACP is purpose-built for **code editor + AI coding agent** scenarios. Zed (the code editor company) created this protocol.

**The Core Problem:**
Traditional AI coding assistants (like Copilot) can only suggest code. But what if you want an agent that can:
- Read multiple files to understand context
- Make edits across multiple files
- Run tests to verify changes
- Execute terminal commands
- All autonomously?

ACP enables this by giving the agent controlled access to:
- **File system**: read/write files in the workspace
- **Terminal**: create sessions, run commands, get output
- **Sessions**: maintain conversation context across multiple interactions

**Our Implementation:**
While we haven't built the full ACP server yet (that's Phase 4), when we do, it will support:
- Natural language credential requests: "Get me the production database credentials"
- Session management: remembering which credentials you've requested
- Intent recognition: understanding what resource you need even from vague descriptions
- Multi-turn conversations: "Actually, I need the staging database instead"

---

**Q: How does ACP handle authentication and sessions differently than A2A?**

**A:** Great comparison question!

**A2A Authentication:**
- Stateless bearer token authentication
- Every request includes `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- No session management - each request is independent
- Token validates the agent's identity

**ACP Authentication:**
- Happens during initialization phase (`/authenticate` endpoint)
- Supports multiple auth methods (API keys, OAuth, custom)
- **Session-based**: after auth, you get a session ID
- All subsequent requests tied to that session
- Session maintains conversation context, user preferences, credential history

**Why the difference?**
- A2A: Designed for microservices/enterprise where stateless is preferred
- ACP: Designed for long-running IDE sessions where context matters

**Example ACP flow:**
1. Initialize: negotiate versions and capabilities
2. Authenticate: prove you're an authorized agent
3. Create Session: start a new conversation
4. Multiple Prompts: "get postgres creds", "now get redis creds", "what did I just request?"
5. Session retains context throughout

---

## 🔒 Security Architecture Q&A

**Q: Walk me through the "zero standing privilege" model. How does it actually work?**

**A:** Zero standing privilege means credentials have **no persistent existence** outside their use window.

**Traditional Approach (Bad):**
- Credentials stored in environment variables or config files
- They sit there forever until manually rotated
- If compromised, attacker has unlimited time to use them
- Hard to audit who accessed what

**Our Approach:**
1. **Just-in-Time**: Credentials only retrieved when requested
2. **Ephemeral**: Default 5-minute lifetime, max 15 minutes
3. **Encrypted**: Wrapped in AES-256 encrypted JWT
4. **Automatic Expiration**: Token expires without human intervention
5. **No Storage**: We never persist credentials - they live in memory only during processing

**Example:**
- 9:00 AM: Agent requests database credentials
- 9:00 AM: We fetch from 1Password, encrypt, issue token
- 9:05 AM: Token expires automatically
- If agent needs credentials again at 9:06 AM, must request fresh token

**Impact:**
- Attack window: 5 minutes instead of forever
- Audit trail: every access logged with timestamp, agent ID, resource
- Compliance: meets regulatory requirements for credential rotation

---

**Q: Why encrypt credentials inside the JWT if JWT is already signed?**

**A:** Excellent security question! JWT signature and encryption serve different purposes:

**JWT Signature (HMAC-SHA256):**
- Proves **integrity**: token hasn't been tampered with
- Proves **authenticity**: token came from us
- Does NOT hide the payload - JWT is base64 encoded, easily decoded

**AES-256 Encryption (Fernet):**
- Provides **confidentiality**: actual passwords/keys are hidden
- Even if someone intercepts the token, they can't read the credentials
- Requires the encryption key to decrypt

**Defense in Depth:**
If an attacker gets the JWT:
- With signature only: they can read the plaintext credentials
- With encryption: they see encrypted gibberish, unusable without the key

**In practice:**
- JWT travels over network (could be logged, cached, etc.)
- We don't want credentials exposed even in encrypted channels
- Encryption key is separate from JWT signing key (different secrets)

---

**Q: How do you prevent credential leakage through logs?**

**A:** This is critical for compliance! We have several safeguards:

**1. Structured Logging:**
- Never log actual credential values (passwords, API keys)
- Only log metadata (resource name, agent ID, timestamp)
- Use separate audit logs vs application logs

**2. Field Filtering:**
```python
# We log this (safe):
{"agent_id": "data-agent", "resource": "database/prod-postgres", "outcome": "success"}

# NEVER log this:
{"password": "secret123", "username": "admin"}
```

**3. Audit Separation:**
- Application logs: help debug issues
- Audit logs: compliance trail, goes to 1Password Events API
- Different retention policies and access controls

**4. Token Representation:**
- In logs, we show only first 20 characters: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...`
- Enough for debugging, not enough to use

**5. Error Handling:**
- Generic error messages to clients
- Detailed errors only in secure logs
- Never include credentials in exception messages

---

**Q: What happens if the 1Password Connect server goes down?**

**A:** We have multiple layers of resilience:

**Health Check System:**
- Periodic health checks to 1Password Connect API
- Track availability status
- Expose health endpoint for monitoring

**Graceful Degradation:**
```
If 1Password unavailable:
  → Return clear error to client: "Credential service temporarily unavailable"
  → Log the outage for ops team
  → Don't crash or hang indefinitely
```

**Retry Logic:**
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Max 3 retries with delays: 1s, 2s, 4s
- If all retries fail, report to client

**Fallback for Audit Logging:**
- Primary: 1Password Events API
- Fallback: Local file logging
- Queue events for retry when API recovers

**Circuit Breaker (Future Enhancement):**
- After N consecutive failures, "open circuit"
- Stop making requests for cooldown period
- Prevents cascade failures and thundering herd

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Track error rates, response times
- Alert ops when health degrades
- Runbooks for incident response

---

## 🛠️ Implementation & Architecture Q&A

**Q: Walk me through your system architecture. What are the main components?**

**A:** We have a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

**Layer 1: Protocol Servers (Interface Layer)**
- MCP Server (stdio transport)
- A2A Server (HTTP/REST + SSE)
- ACP Server (HTTP/REST + sessions) - planned Phase 4

Each server translates protocol-specific requests into core operations.

**Layer 2: Core Infrastructure (Business Logic)**
- **CredentialManager**: Orchestrates the entire flow
  - Validates resource types
  - Coordinates between OnePasswordClient and TokenManager
  - Health checks
  
- **TokenManager**: Handles cryptography
  - Generates JWT tokens
  - AES-256 encryption/decryption
  - Key derivation (PBKDF2)
  - Token validation
  
- **OnePasswordClient**: Integrates with 1Password
  - Async API calls
  - Vault and item operations
  - Field extraction
  - Error handling
  
- **AuditLogger**: Compliance trail
  - Posts events to 1Password Events API
  - Local fallback logging
  - Retry logic

**Layer 3: External Services**
- 1Password Connect API
- 1Password Events API
- Vault storage

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Dependency Injection**: Core components accept dependencies (testable, flexible)
- **Async/Await**: All I/O operations non-blocking
- **Protocol Agnostic Core**: Same core logic serves all three protocols
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models everywhere

---

**Q: Why did you choose FastAPI for the A2A server?**

**A:** FastAPI was the obvious choice for several reasons:

**1. Performance:**
- One of the fastest Python frameworks
- Built on Starlette (async) and Pydantic (validation)
- Handles concurrent requests efficiently

**2. Type Safety:**
- Native type hints and validation
- Pydantic models prevent invalid requests at the edge
- Reduces runtime errors

**3. Automatic Documentation:**
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs generated automatically
- Interactive API testing UI
- Matches A2A's self-describing philosophy

**4. Async Native:**
- First-class async/await support
- Perfect for I/O-bound operations (1Password API calls)
- Non-blocking request handling

**5. Developer Experience:**
- Dependency injection built-in (used for auth)
- Easy middleware support (CORS)
- Excellent error handling

**Example:**
```python
@app.post("/task", response_model=A2ATaskResponse)
async def execute_task(
    request: A2ATaskRequest,  # Auto-validates
    agent_id: str = Depends(verify_bearer_token),  # DI for auth
):
    # FastAPI handles validation, auth, serialization automatically
```

---

**Q: How does async/await improve your system's performance?**

**A:** Async/await is crucial for our I/O-bound workload:

**The Problem:**
Credential provisioning involves:
1. Network call to 1Password API (50-200ms)
2. Cryptographic operations (10-50ms)
3. Audit log posting (20-100ms)

With synchronous code, thread blocks during each I/O operation. With 100 concurrent requests, you'd need 100 threads.

**Async Solution:**
- While waiting for 1Password API, event loop handles other requests
- Single thread can manage hundreds of concurrent operations
- Better CPU utilization, less memory overhead

**Real Impact:**
```
Synchronous: 10 requests/second (blocked on I/O)
Async: 100+ requests/second (event loop multiplexing)
```

**Where We Use Async:**
- All 1Password API calls: `await client.get_item(...)`
- Audit logging: `await audit_logger.log_credential_access(...)`
- Server-Sent Events: `async def event_generator()`
- Request handlers: `async def execute_task(...)`

**When NOT to Use:**
- CPU-intensive operations (encryption) - but they're fast enough
- Database transactions with complex locking (we don't have a DB)

---

**Q: How would you scale this system to handle thousands of concurrent requests?**

**A:** Great question! Several strategies:

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Deploy multiple broker instances
- Put them behind a load balancer (Nginx, AWS ALB)
- Stateless design makes this easy (no session affinity needed)

**Connection Pooling:**
- Reuse HTTP connections to 1Password API
- Configure pool size based on API rate limits
- Avoid connection overhead

**Caching:**
- Cache vault metadata (rarely changes)
- Cache health check results (30-60 seconds)
- Consider credential caching with TTL (risky, evaluate security impact)

**Rate Limiting:**
- Per-agent rate limits (prevent abuse)
- Token bucket or sliding window algorithms
- Return 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded

**Async Workers:**
- Separate audit logging into background queue
- Don't block credential delivery on audit success
- Use Celery or Redis Queue

**Monitoring & Metrics:**
- Track: requests/second, latency, error rate, token expiration rate
- Use Prometheus + Grafana
- Auto-scale based on metrics

**Database (If Needed):**
- Currently we're stateless (great!)
- If we add rate limiting or session management, use Redis
- Fast in-memory storage for temporary state

---

**Q: Tell me about your testing strategy. How do you ensure reliability?**

**A:** We have a comprehensive testing pyramid:

**Unit Tests:**
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock external dependencies (1Password API)
- Focus on business logic correctness
- Example: token generation, encryption, validation

**Integration Tests:**
- Test protocol servers end-to-end
- Use real MCP/A2A clients
- Verify complete flows work correctly
- Example: MCP client requests credentials, receives valid token

**Security Tests:**
- Token expiration enforcement
- Invalid token rejection
- Encryption/decryption correctness
- Auth bypass attempts

**Phase Testing:**
- **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure unit tests
- **Phase 2**: MCP server integration tests
- **Phase 3**: A2A server integration tests
- **Phase 4**: ACP server integration tests

**Test Coverage:**
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Critical paths (credential flow) at 100%
- Use pytest with coverage reporting

**Manual Testing:**
- Demo scripts for each protocol
- Health check validation
- Production-like environment testing

## 🎤 Scenario-Based Interview Questions

**Q: An agent is requesting credentials but getting "resource not found" errors. How would you debug this?**

**A:** I'd follow a systematic debugging approach:

**1. Verify the Request:**
- Check what `resource_type` and `resource_name` were provided
- Confirm they match what's actually in 1Password
- Common mistake: typo in resource name or wrong vault

**2. Check 1Password Integration:**
- Is 1Password Connect server healthy? Call health endpoint
- Can we list vaults? Try `GET /vaults`
- Does the item actually exist? Search manually in 1Password

**3. Review Audit Logs:**
- What does the audit trail show? "failure" or "error"?
- Check application logs for detailed error messages
- Look for patterns (all requests failing vs specific resource)

**4. Validate Permissions:**
- Does the Connect token have access to that vault?
- Are there vault-level permissions blocking access?

**5. Test Manually:**
- Use our demo script with the same resource name
- Try with a known-good resource (like "test-db")
- Isolate whether it's this resource or all resources

**6. Return Helpful Error:**
- Give the agent actionable info: "Resource 'prod-postgres' not found in vault 'Production'. Available resources: ..."
- Don't expose sensitive vault structure to unauthorized agents

---

**Q: You notice the average credential retrieval time has increased from 200ms to 2 seconds. What do you investigate?**

**A:** Performance degradation - let's troubleshoot:

**1. Identify the Bottleneck:**
- Add timing metrics to each operation:
  - 1Password API call time
  - Encryption time
  - Audit logging time
  - Network latency
- Pinpoint which component slowed down

**2. Check 1Password API:**
- Are we hitting rate limits? Check response headers
- Is Connect server under load? Check its health
- Network issues? Test latency directly: `curl 1password-host`

**3. Review System Resources:**
- CPU usage on broker host
- Memory pressure
- Network bandwidth
- Open file descriptors (connection leaks?)

**4. Examine Recent Changes:**
- Did we deploy new code?
- Did 1Password Connect update?
- Configuration changes?
- Increased request volume?

**5. Check Concurrent Load:**
- How many requests are in flight?
- Are we overwhelming a single-threaded component?
- Connection pool exhausted?

**6. Audit Logging Issues:**
- Is Events API slow or timing out?
- Are we retrying failed audit posts (exponential backoff)?
- Consider async audit logging (don't block credential delivery)

**Quick Win:**
- Add caching for vault metadata
- Increase connection pool size
- Implement request queuing if overloaded

---

**Q: A security audit reveals that a token was used 30 minutes after issuance, even though TTL is 5 minutes. How is this possible? How do you fix it?**

**A:** This is a critical security issue! Let's investigate:

**Possible Causes:**

**1. Clock Skew:**
- Client and server have different system times
- JWT expiration checks use timestamps
- If client clock is 25 minutes behind, token appears valid

**Fix:**
- Validate token expiration server-side (never trust client)
- Consider adding a "not before" (`nbf`) claim
- Monitor system clock synchronization (NTP)

**2. Token Validation Bug:**
- Are we checking expiration correctly?
- Review code: `if token.exp < current_time`
- Check timezone handling (UTC vs local time)

**Fix:**
- Add unit test specifically for expired tokens
- Use python-jose's built-in expiration checking
- Log a warning when expired tokens are attempted

**3. Cached Token:**
- Client cached the token and keeps reusing it
- Our validation happens on first use only?

**Fix:**
- Document that tokens must be validated on every use
- Consider adding a token revocation list (complexity++)

**4. Token Reuse:**
- Different agent copied the token
- Shared credentials between agents

**Fix:**
- Add agent identity binding
- Log warnings on suspicious reuse patterns
- Consider one-time-use tokens (adds complexity)

**Immediate Action:**
- Review all token validation code
- Add test case for this exact scenario
- Check audit logs for other instances
- Consider temporary TTL reduction (5 → 2 minutes)

---

**Q: An agent team wants to cache credentials for 1 hour to reduce API calls. How do you respond?**

**A:** This requires a thoughtful, security-first response:

**My Response:**
"I understand the performance concern, but credential caching fundamentally undermines our zero standing privilege model. Let's explore why and discuss alternatives."

**Why It's Problematic:**

**1. Security Risk:**
- Credentials persisting for 1 hour = 12x larger attack window
- If agent is compromised, attacker has credentials for an hour
- Defeats the purpose of ephemeral credentials

**2. Compliance Issues:**
- Audit trail becomes misleading (one access logged, many uses)
- Harder to prove credential access patterns
- May violate regulatory requirements

**3. Credential Rotation:**
- If credentials are rotated in 1Password, cached version is stale
- Creates operational headaches

**Alternative Solutions:**

**1. Increase Our TTL (Carefully):**
- Current: 5 minutes default
- Propose: 15 minutes for specific, justified use cases
- Require explicit approval and documentation

**2. Optimize Request Path:**
- Add connection pooling if not already present
- Cache vault metadata (not credentials)
- Reduce round trips

**3. Batch Requests:**
- If agent needs multiple resources, fetch all at once
- Reduce total request count

**4. Long-Lived Sessions (A2A/ACP):**
- Session lasts hours, but tokens refreshed automatically
- Transparent to the agent
- Maintains 5-minute credential lifecycle

**5. Performance Metrics:**
- Measure actual impact: is 200ms really a bottleneck?
- Often the database query takes 10x longer than credential fetch

**Compromise:**
- Pilot with 15-minute TTL for their use case
- Monitor security metrics
- Review after 30 days

## 🚀 Future & Best Practices Q&A

**Q: What would Phase 4 (ACP Server) implementation involve?**

**A:** Phase 4 is the most complex because ACP requires natural language understanding:

**Key Components:**

**1. Session Management:**
- Create/load/persist conversation sessions
- Track: conversation history, requested credentials, agent preferences
- Session timeout and cleanup

**2. Natural Language Processing:**
- Parse requests like: "I need database credentials for the prod environment"
- Extract: resource_type=database, environment=prod
- Handle ambiguity: "Which database? We have prod-postgres, prod-mysql"

**3. Intent Recognition:**
- Map user intent to capabilities
- "connect to postgres" → `request_database_credentials`
- "access the API" → `request_api_credentials`

**4. Multi-Turn Conversations:**
```
Agent: "Get me database credentials"
Server: "Which database? Production or staging?"
Agent: "Production"
Server: "Here's your token: ..."
```

**5. Context Management:**
- Remember what was discussed earlier in session
- "Give me those again" → knows which credentials
- "Switch to staging" → understands context switch

**6. File System Integration (Optional):**
- If ACP includes fs capabilities
- Write credentials to .env file securely
- Clean up after session ends

**Technical Approach:**
- Use LLM (like Claude API) for intent extraction
- Structured prompt engineering
- Fallback to explicit commands if NLP fails
- Maintain session state in Redis

---

**Q: How would you add support for credential rotation in this system?**

**A:** Credential rotation adds significant complexity. Here's how I'd approach it:

**Current State:**
- We fetch credentials on-demand from 1Password
- If credentials rotate in 1Password, next request gets new ones
- Automatic rotation support (to an extent)

**Enhanced Rotation:**

**1. Rotation Notifications:**
- Subscribe to 1Password Events API
- Listen for "credential updated" events
- Notify active token holders (if we track them)

**2. Token Revocation:**
- Maintain a revocation list (Redis)
- When credentials rotate, mark old tokens invalid
- Validate against revocation list on every use

**3. Grace Period:**
- During rotation, both old and new credentials valid
- Prevents disruption to active operations
- Window: 5-10 minutes

**4. Active Token Tracking:**
- Store issued tokens (hashed) with expiration
- On rotation, identify affected agents
- Send "reauth required" notification

**5. Agent Notification Protocol:**
- Add webhook support to A2A
- POST to agent's callback URL: `{event: "credentials_rotated", resource: "database/prod-postgres"}`
- Agent requests fresh token

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add token storage (Redis, with TTL)
2. Subscribe to 1Password Events
3. Implement revocation checks
4. Add webhook delivery
5. Update agent SDKs with rotation handling

**Trade-offs:**
- Adds state (no longer fully stateless)
- More complex error handling
- But: better security and smoother rotation experience

---

**Q: What monitoring and observability would you add for production?**

**A:** Comprehensive monitoring is critical for production. Here's my approach:

**Metrics to Track:**

**1. Request Metrics:**
- Requests per second (by protocol)
- Success rate (% successful)
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate by error type

**2. Token Metrics:**
- Tokens issued per minute
- Token validation attempts
- Expired token attempts (security concern!)
- Average token lifetime used (vs granted)

**3. Resource Metrics:**
- Most requested resources
- Failed resource lookups
- Credential fetch times by resource

**4. Security Metrics:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Invalid token usage patterns
- Multiple agents using same token
- After-hours access anomalies

**5. System Health:**
- 1Password API availability
- Events API availability
- Request queue depth
- Memory/CPU usage

**Implementation:**

**Prometheus Metrics:**
```python
credential_requests_total = Counter('credential_requests_total', 'Total credential requests', ['protocol', 'resource_type'])
credential_request_duration = Histogram('credential_request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')
token_validation_failures = Counter('token_validation_failures_total', 'Failed token validations', ['reason'])
```

**Grafana Dashboards:**
- Overview: RPS, error rate, latency
- Security: failed auths, suspicious activity
- Resources: top requested, performance by resource
- Alerts: error rate >5%, latency >1s, 1Password down

**Alerting Rules:**
- Error rate >5% for 5 minutes → page on-call
- 1Password unavailable → immediate alert
- Expired token attempts spike → security investigation
- Memory usage >80% → warning

**Logging:**
- Structured JSON logs
- Include: trace_id, agent_id, resource, duration, outcome
- Ship to Elasticsearch or CloudWatch
- Retention: 90 days audit logs, 30 days application logs

**Tracing:**
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Trace request through: protocol server → core → 1Password → audit
- Identify slow components visually

**Q: How would you design a disaster recovery plan for this system?**

**A:** DR is crucial for credential infrastructure. Here's my plan:

**Failure Scenarios:**

**1. Broker Failure:**
- **Impact**: Agents can't get new credentials
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Deploy multiple broker instances (multi-AZ)
  - Health check + auto-restart
  - RTO: < 5 minutes (auto-scaling)
  - RPO: 0 (stateless)

**2. 1Password Connect Failure:**
- **Impact**: Can't fetch credentials from vault
- **Mitigation**:
  - Deploy Connect server in HA mode
  - Fallback to secondary Connect instance
  - Cache frequently-used credentials (with security review)
  - RTO: < 2 minutes (automatic failover)

**3. 1Password Events API Failure:**
- **Impact**: Audit events not delivered
- **Mitigation**:
  - Already have local file fallback
  - Queue events in Redis
  - Replay when API recovers
  - RPO: 0 (no audit loss)

**4. Complete Region Failure:**
- **Impact**: All services down
- **Mitigation**:
  - Deploy in multiple regions
  - Global load balancer
  - RTO: < 30 minutes (DNS failover)

**5. Data Loss (if we add state):**
- **Impact**: Lost session data, token revocation list
- **Mitigation**:
  - Redis persistence enabled
  - Regular backups
  - Multi-replica deployment

**DR Procedures:**

**Runbooks:**
1. Broker not responding → check health, restart, check logs
2. 1Password unreachable → verify Connect server, check network, failover
3. High error rate → check recent deployments, roll back if needed
4. Security incident → revoke all tokens, rotate keys, audit logs

**Testing:**
- Monthly DR drills
- Chaos engineering (randomly kill instances)
- Load testing (2x expected peak)

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Detect failure (monitoring alerts)
2. Automatic failover (load balancer)
3. Manual intervention if needed
4. Root cause analysis post-incident

### How to Present This Project

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
"I built a universal credential broker that provides ephemeral, just-in-time credentials to AI agents. It supports three different agent communication protocols - MCP, A2A, and ACP - so it works with any AI framework. Credentials expire after 5 minutes, are AES-256 encrypted, and every access is audited. It's basically zero-trust security for AI agents."

**Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes):**
"The architecture has three layers: protocol servers that speak MCP, A2A, and ACP; a core infrastructure layer that handles 1Password integration, token generation, and audit logging; and external integrations with 1Password's Connect and Events APIs. The system is fully async for performance, uses JWT with embedded AES-256 encrypted credentials, and implements zero standing privilege - credentials have a 5-minute lifetime by default. I chose to support three protocols because different AI ecosystems have different needs: MCP for AI assistants like Claude, A2A for agent-to-agent collaboration, and ACP for code editor integration."

**Results/Impact:**
- Reduces credential exposure window from days/months to 5 minutes
- Provides complete audit trail for compliance
- Enables secure AI agent operations in production environments
- Supports emerging agent ecosystems (MCP, CrewAI, Claude)

### Common Follow-Up Questions

**"Why not use environment variables?"**
Environment variables persist indefinitely, can leak through logs/errors, are hard to rotate, and lack audit trail. Ephemeral tokens solve all these issues.

**"Isn't 5 minutes too short for real workloads?"**
Most operations complete in seconds. For longer operations, agents can request fresh tokens. We support up to 15 minutes for justified use cases. The risk of compromise grows exponentially with TTL.

**"How does this compare to HashiCorp Vault?"**
Vault is a general secret manager. We're specialized for AI agent workflows with protocol support (MCP/A2A/ACP), shorter-lived credentials, and agent-specific audit trails. We could actually integrate Vault as a backend instead of 1Password.

**"What if multiple agents need the same credentials?"**
Each agent gets their own token (with own expiry and audit trail). If they truly need shared access, we can issue multiple tokens for the same resource - still individually auditable.

**"How would you monetize this as a product?"**
- SaaS: $0.10 per 1000 credential requests
- Self-hosted: enterprise license ($50k/year)
- Value prop: reduce security incidents (worth millions)
- Compliance certification (SOC2, HIPAA)
